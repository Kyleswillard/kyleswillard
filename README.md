#### Who I am
It has been a long crazy road filled with amazing employers, equally amazing coworkers, and professional, as well as life lessons. 
My background has been predominantly Retail Sales, and customer service, but my obsession has been technology, and web design.
I am the guy that shows up 15-30 minutes early because I feel like I am late otherwise, the guy that will work late just to get those final touches in. 
I really made a hard pivot into Programming when I hit a wall that really showed me that I needed to make a career change. I dove head first and consumed as much as possible from as many sources as possible to become a proficient, clean, and organized software engineer. 

#### What I like
I started my journey into web development loving the idea that I could create, and mould things into the image in my brain. That level of control and creativity was a huge plus for me. I have always enjoyed doing creative things, but rarely had a medium that I was comfortable sharing my creations, and web development certainly granted that. 

I enjoy doing front end for sure. I use react, and all of the standard tools that you would attribute to it, but I have to say that as I explore the back end I have started to really fall in love with the purist, logical side that hammering out a server offers. It is a lot more cut and dry, and concise, and it feels like the backbone of the entire ecosystem that I am working on. Due to that I dove pretty hard into the MERN stack, while also learning Knex & SQL. In addition to add a bit more spice I added GraphQL to keep things cleaner, and in my mind more concise, and I am adept at using all of them.
